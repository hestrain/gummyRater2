## Installation
You do not have to install Gummy Rater to rate gummies, you can visit it live online at [This Link - coming soon](https://gummyRater2.onrender.com/)

However, if you'd like to ruin it locally instead, please follow the below instructions: 

1. Clone project repository down into your desired directory
2. Open project terminal in the root level and run the command `npm install` to install the packages and dependencies. Installing in the root level will install the dependencies and packages for both the Client and Server
3. In that same terminal, run the command `npm run develop`, this will concurrently start the Client and Server
4. Visit the application at https://localhost:3000

## Usage

Gummy Rater is a user filled database for w33d gummies using restful API.
